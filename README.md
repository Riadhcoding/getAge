# getAge

A React Native app that calculates your age based on your year of birth.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Download the Source Code**

   Download the source code and open the project directory in [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Open a terminal in VS Code and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
## Run


   **Run Your App**
   ```bash
   npx expo start
```

### Explanation:
- **Image Syntax**: `![Alt text](URL)` is the Markdown syntax for images. 
  - `![App Screenshot]` is the alt text that describes the image.
  - `(https://github.com/Riadhcoding/getAge/blob/main/assets/screen.png)` is the URL of the image.
- **Alt Text**: Replace `"App Screenshot"` with a descriptive text for the image. This helps with accessibility and SEO.

### Notes:
- **Direct Image Link**: Ensure the URL directly points to the image file itself (not a webpage). The URL provided seems correct for embedding.
- **File Size**: Ensure the image file size is not too large, as it can impact the loading time of the README file.

This setup will embed the image directly in the GitHub README file, providing a visual preview of your app.
